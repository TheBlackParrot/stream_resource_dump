*(Beatmap data structure changed after 1.34 and this required a tiny tweak to update iPixelGalaxy's modifications in order to make it functional on 1.35+)*
- patched with an updated version of iPixelGalaxy's modifications (commit 6aedd8d of https://github.com/iPixelGalaxy/BeatSaber_BetterSongList/commit/6aedd8dbc7a1ab0a802c4b731eb9c8eebc35084c) and some personal changes
	- add RT/JD value display
		- RT values automatically swap to seconds over milliseconds if at or above 1 second RT
	- select preferred leaderboard service
	- removed PP display (there are more in-depth mods for this now)
	- ranked stars now hide themselves if the selected map/diff is not ranked
