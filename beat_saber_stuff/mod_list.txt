Unless otherwise noted with a URL, these mods should be found in BeatMods's repositories (via ModAssistant).
Naluluna mods are available through her own mod manager.

I'm currently using version 1.39.1 of the game.

My queue manager is externally controlled through Firebot and dynamically generated playlists; there is no in-game mod.
